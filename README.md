# Gradient Descent Example - Machine Learning
This is code to practice concepts of Gradient Descent.

## Overview

This code is implementing gradient descent to find the line of best fit that predicts the relationship between:

* Critic Score for a Video Game AND
* Global Sales (in USD) for the Video Game

You can look at this data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings).

This code is doing a linear regression with gradient descent to predict the mapping. 

## Dependencies

* Python/numpy

## Usage

Just run ``python3 gradient-descent.py`` to see the results:

```
Started gradient descent. b = 0, m = 0, error = 4950.687807276303
Running...
Finished after 8000 iterations. b = 79.98363551659658, m = 0.7998363551659666, error = 319.6522102894599
```
